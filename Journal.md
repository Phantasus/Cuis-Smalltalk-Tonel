I looked at my old image, which I used for the last pharo8 export
mentioned in the initial commit. Just for correctness I mention it
here again:

> Pharo 8.0.0
> Build information: Pharo-8.0.0+build.1124.sha.0932da82f08175e906b0e2a8052120c823374e9f (64 Bit)

I still had the local version of this now a year old image snapshot
in locally and the associated "Welcome to pharo message was"

> Pharo8.0.0
> build: 1124, commit: 0932da8

I cloned the latest git snapshot from here:

> git@github.com:pharo-project/pharo.git

And the actual commit message, based on the above commit hash was:

> commit 0932da82f08175e906b0e2a8052120c823374e9f (tag: v8.0.1)
> Merge: e8562c1590 c7c95a8466
> Author: St√©phaneDucasse <stephane.ducasse@inria.fr>
> Date:   Wed Jan 22 20:40:40 2020 +0100
>
>    Merge pull request #5554 from estebanlm/fix-predebug-error
>    
>    fix-predebug-error

I record that here, so that people can extract the actual AUTHORs
information and put the rest together.

I got frustrated by using Pharo to open tonel packages and filing
them out by hand for porting packages to Cuis. At some point
I thought that through the trendy-technology driven development
cycles of Pharo something old fashioned like filing out categories
and classes to .st are going to be removed, breaking the Smalltalk
Interoperability again and splitting the communities again!

Rant! Rant! Ugh! Curse!

So I just filled out the highly monticello specific implementation
of tonel from pharo 8

> Pharo 8.0.0
> Build information: Pharo-8.0.0+build.1124.sha.0932da82f08175e906b0e2a8052120c823374e9f (64 Bit)

and added it to the repository. Could be a starting ground.
