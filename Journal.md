I got frustrated by using Pharo to open tonel packages and filing
them out by hand for porting packages to Cuis. At some point
I thought that through the trendy-technology driven development
cycles of Pharo something old fashioned like filing out categories
and classes to .st are going to be removed, breaking the Smalltalk
Interoperability again and splitting the communities again!

Rant! Rant! Ugh! Curse!

So I just filled out the highly monticello specific implementation
of tonel from pharo 8

> Pharo 8.0.0
> Build information: Pharo-8.0.0+build.1124.sha.0932da82f08175e906b0e2a8052120c823374e9f (64 Bit)

and added it to the repository. Could be a starting ground.
